Title: Designing a Binding Peptide for ACE2 Interface of the SARS-COV-2 Spike Protein RBD

Abstract: Our goal was to design a binding peptide for ACE2 interface of the SARS-COV-2 spike protein RBD. Given the limited computation time available, we decided to focus on improving the single helix binding domain of ACE2, with the knowledge that an experimentally feasible mini-protein binder would likely require additional domains to be stable. Our design strategy, in summary, was as follows: 1) generate new backbones with Remodel, 2) optimize backbone design with FastDesign and Docking movers, and 3) explore further optimization of best scoring decoy with NCAA substitution. We implemented this using Python and PyMOL.
